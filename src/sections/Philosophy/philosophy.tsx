          In our team, developers work alongside designers, strategists and
          analysts. Leifii doesn't do cookie-cutter solutions and we build
          products exactly as they were during the design phase, no short cuts
          or simplifications.<br></br> <br />
          We're driven by userâ€‘centered design that drives productivity and
          increases revenue. Our expertise and ingenuity are remarkable, yet we
          always strive to outdo and outperform our previous achievements.
